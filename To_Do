This file represents the things to do and the things that are done 

Project in Steps 

Develop the web application interface basic 
    There should be sliding windows
    There should be sliders and text boxes to set sensor values
    It should be able to read the commands from the excel sheet and execute them
    There should be a real time graph that should plot the values of the sensor with regards to the time
    There should be an indicator for sensors that would tell which sensors or valves are active at the moment

Python script to connect to the senors 
    The script should follow a OOPs approach and should be able to connect with all the present sensors
    The sensors should be able be able to controll the sensors

Python script to controll the sensors
    The script should interact with the data loader and activate the sensors at sepcific time
    The script should return the activity of the sensors to the front end of the application
    The script should save the values in the csv file that should be read by the front end at regular intervals
     

Things done

Develop the web application interface basic - Partially Done 
    There should be sliding windows
    It is able to read commands from the python script 
    The graph is not set to plot real time data - inprogress
