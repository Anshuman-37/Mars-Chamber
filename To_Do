This file represents the things to do and the things that are done 

Project in Steps 

Develop the web application interface basic 
    There should be sliding windows
    There should be sliders and text boxes to set sensor values
    It should be able to read the commands from the excel sheet and execute them
    There should be a real time graph that should plot the values of the sensor with regards to the time
    There should be an indicator for sensors that would tell which sensors or valves are active at the moment

Python script to connect to the senors 
    The script should follow a OOPs approach and should be able to connect with all the present sensors
    The script should be able be able to controll the sensors

Python script to controll the sensors with commands
    The script should interact with the data loader and activate the sensors at sepcific time
    The script should return the activity of the sensors to the front end of the application
    The script should save the values in the csv file that should be read by the front end at regular intervals
     

Things done

Develop the web application interface basic - Partially Done 
    There should be sliding windows
    There are sliders but still cant change to a given value - inprogress need to study a bit more REACT (2 weeks)
    It is able to read commands from the python script - In progress to extract data from the CSV in real time
    The graph is not set to plot real time data - inprogress 
    There is no indicator for the sensors yet - waiting for the python script to do it

Python script to connect to the sensors
    Created a Frame Work to connect to the sensors - waiting to go in the lab to work with real sensors
    The script still can't controll the sensors - still haven't worked with sensors

Things Done 
    Connected to the sensors and created their OOPS format
    Stored the result in csv file 
    Plotting the real time values from the sensors
    Plotting the real time datas from the senors humidity and temperature

#############################################################################
Python script to controll the sensors with commands
    The script should be able to interact with the data loader - can be done easily when sensors are connected to the script 
    The script is still not ready to return the values of the sensors - Could be done easily by using a OOPS approach 



#############################################################################
Write a threading based interface for the application and connect the backend to the fronted GUI
    This will allow and let us call the values from the GUI and the Sensors simultanouesly 
    The variables will be stored in the shared memory. 
    Due to this they can be accessed by frontend and backend of the application

    Threading done achieving a 5x speed up to display the sensors data and 3x speed with the graphs in the code
    Successfully implemented the heat control sensor and is able to control its switching on and off with the use of Threading. 


The next steps are to implement a reading of CSV file from which we will be able to read the commands those commands will be used to update the temperature sensors and the other sensors.
